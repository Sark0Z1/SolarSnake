# Casual classic game "Snake" - Solar Snake

## The project was developed in C++ using Unreal Engine 4 (v. 4.27).
<br>

### The playing field is a forest clearing on which we control a snake that catches sunbeams. On the way the snake comes across dew drops and stones.
<br>

### Game conditions:
1. Catch as many sunbeams as possible. After catching the target, a new body element is added to the body of the snake.
2. Periodically, stones and dew drops appear randomly on the map. They remain on the playing field for 10 to 20 seconds, after which they disappear.
3. When catching a stone, the snake slows down movement by 5%.
4. When catching a drop of dew, the snake accelerates by 5%.
5. The game time is not limited.
6. If the snake bites its body or crashes into a stone wall, the game is lost.
